_Should I use it?_ **Not yet**

_The algorithm is generally working and should be quite optimal. The tests are
quite rich now and cover many aspects and things that can go wrong. However, I
am at a stage at which I keep finding bugs and not working cases. Come back in
two weeks and you should see vastly improved (and even faster) version,
hopefully ready for a real world usage._

2D triangulation library. Allows translating lines and polygons (both based on
points) to the language of GPUs.

Features normal and miter joint line triangulation. Handles polygons using ear
clipping algorithm ~~with hole elimination included~~ (**WIP**).

## Usage

#### Basic example
```go
vertices := []Point{{10, 20}, {30, 40}, {50, 60}}
t, err = triangolatte.EarCut(vertices)
```

## Installation

Nothing surprising
```bash
go get github.com/Tchayen/triangolatte
```

## Examples

For rendering examples, go to `examples/webgl` directory.

You will find instructions for running the code there.

## Features

> **NOTE**: _this library is developed mostly with map data triangulation in
mind and it will be its main performance target once it reaches benchmarking
phase_

### API

#### `EarCut(points []Point, holes [][]Point) ([]float64, error)`

Based on the following [paper](https://www.geometrictools.com/Documentation/TriangulationByEarClipping.pdf).

Removes holes, joining them with the rest of the polygon.

#### `Normal(points []Point, width int) (triangles []float64)`

Normal triangulation. Produces joints that are ugly in zoom, but fast to compute
and sometimes acceptable.

#### `Miter(points []Point, width int) (triangles []float64)`

Triangulates lines using miter joint. With little computational overhead,
produces no more vertices than normal one. Comes with one drawback: very sharp
angles can potentially explode to infinity.

Refer to this [forum post](https://forum.libcinder.org/topic/smooth-thick-lines-using-geometry-shader)
for sketches, code examples and ideas.

### Types

For calculations using points.
```
type Point struct {
  X, Y float64
}
```

## Tests

Code is (more or less) covered in tests. You can run them:

```bash
go test -v
```

You can for example benchmark speed of checking if point is inside triangle:

```bash
go test -run NONE -bench IsInsideTriangle
```

### Flame Graphs

What is a _flame graph_? Simply speaking, a human-readable insight into what
kept CPU busy (and it resembles fire ðŸ”¥).

It has intelligent zoom that lets you narrow down the range to a particular
function from the flame and go back quickly at will.

It also supports hovering while still being a regular, valid `*.svg` file.

![assets/torch.svg](assets/torch.svg)

You can view an example of `EarCut` benchmark flame graph in [assets/torch.svg](assets/torch.svg).

> **NOTE:** _you must display the image file directly to use cool features
described above._

#### Generating flame graph

Install [go-torch](https://github.com/uber/go-torch) and [FlameGraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph)
if you haven't done it before

```bash
go get github.com/uber/go-torch
git clone https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/FlameGraph # You might want to add this to your .bashrc or other equivalent
```

From now on, every time you want to generate a flame graph, simply run the
commands below:

> You can replace `EarCut` with any function name from `*_test.go` file, with
> name starting with `Benchmark*`, stripping the prefix.
>
> For example, `func BenchmarkEarCut(...)` became `EarCut`.

```bash
go test -run NONE -bench EarCut -cpuprofile prof.cpu
go tool pprof triangolatte.test prof.cpu
go-torch triangolatte.test prof.cpu
```

Now you can open newly generated `torch.svg` in your web browser.

## Future plans

### Optimizations

**First:** rewrite ear list from list to a queue implemented on array. It should
be rather easy and will save tons of mallocs.

`EarCut` currently uses `O(n^2)` algorithm which does not have much space
remaining for improvement.

However, there are other obvious options for
speeding up vertex traversal using some kind of z-ordering (checking close
vertices first increases chance of proving that given vertex cannot be an ear
and therefore makes occasion for early return).

### Making the library production grade

By providing more examples, real benchmarks with comparison to other languages,
libraries. Testing behavior on huge, unusual real life examples.

### WebAssembly

One of the core plans for this library's development is creating, as soon as it
becomes possible, some kind of [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) module
for use in JS.
