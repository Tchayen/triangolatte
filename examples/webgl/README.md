Those are the points visible in the screenshot above:

```
{{50, 110}, {150, 30}, {240, 115}, {320, 65}, {395, 170}, {305, 160}, {265, 240}, {190, 100}, {95, 125}, {100, 215}}
```

Run the Go server with

```bash
go run server.go
```

then, watch JS files in separate terminal
```bash
yarn start
```
and finally, visit `localhost:3000`.
